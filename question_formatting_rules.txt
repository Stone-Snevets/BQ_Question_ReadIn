For better use with this program, keep the following rules in mind:
1. Ensure the Introductory Remarks, Question, and Answer all start a new line respectively
2. Ensure there is a valid reference beginning each Answer
3. Each part of the question (Intro, Question, Answer) must NOT have any new line characters withtin them
   -> It is fine when, if it is long enough, the Intro, Question, or Answer takes up multiple lines in the document.
   -> That is treated as one line.
   -> Just DON'T press enter anywhere within the Intro, Question, or Answer respectively.

Failure to comply with these rules may result in incorrect output or an error.
